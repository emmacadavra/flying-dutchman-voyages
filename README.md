# **Flying Dutchman Voyages - _"Sailing Until Doomsday!_**

## **Project Overview**

Flying Dutchman Voyages offers a one-of-a-kind experience - cruises on the fabled ghost ship, The Flying Dutchman. Customers are able to choose from a modest selection of unique rooms on board, from the opulant Captain's Quarters (of which the spectral Captain Hendrick Van der Decken no longer has any need), to 'The Brig' - lovingly named so for its location, though it is anything but a prison. They can make and manage bookings, learn a little about the vessel itself, as well as discover the spectacular events Flying Dutchman Voyages has to offer.

## **Planning Stages**


### **Site Aims**

The primary aim for the Flying Dutchman Voyages project is to provide a seamless, user-friendly link between the services offered by Flying Dutchman Voyages, and potential customers looking to make a booking for a voyage. This link crucially includes information about The Flying Dutchman, and provides site users with a clear view of the rooms available to them. It provides the means to make a booking, amend existing bookings, and cancel bookings with ease - remaining clear and consistent for a smooth user experience.

Additionally, from the perspective of site admins, it provides a user-friendly way to manage site content by adding, removing and updating rooms, as well as the ability to view, update and cancel all bookings made by users through the site - all from one convenient admin page.
